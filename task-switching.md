# task-switching
when there are *numerous tasks*, use **windows + <number>** or **windows + T** to switch among tasks, instead of using alt + tab, 
which takes more time
---
when opening a task which has only one instance(such as vscode, eclipse and idea), just click the icon on the task bar
---
when opening a task which presumably has many instances, open the task view on the task bar, then choose the target task
